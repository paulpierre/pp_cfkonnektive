My business partner and I found that as great a platform Click Funnels was, it's merchant processing is terrible and limited. I built a javascript integration that allows you to halt the normal flow of Click Funnels and extract the data to complete the transaction in Konnektive securely. 

Easily load balance multiple MIDs, combat fraud in a far more efficient way, directly in Konnektive with the visuals of Click Funnels.

How it works
------------

The actual manual setup is a bit of a pain because you have to both create the Click Funnels campaign
as well as create an identical funnel within Konnektive. But hey, we won't let work get in the way of
massive profits right?

That's why I create a shell script that does the heavy lifting. Steps:

* Visually create your campaign in Click Funnels, including upsells. Don't worry, we will neuter their code 
* Construct your Konnektive campaign identical to the funnel above
* Create a landing page for this within Konnektive, remember to make sure the campaign is e-commerce type
* Download the zip file and copy the zip file to the "zip" folder
* chmod +x and run funnel.sh in the command line and follow the prompts
* Make sure you have your own git repo setup as my shell script will push to git for you
* Also make sure that your production server setup matches up secure.mydomain.com/funnels/funnel_name_here
* And voila, Clickfunnels and Konnektive just had an ugly but mega profitable baby.
